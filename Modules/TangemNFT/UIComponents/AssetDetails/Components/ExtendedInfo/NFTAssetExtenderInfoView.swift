This is not just a digital artifact — it's a key to the secrets hidden in our realm. Fate has smiled upon you, for you have received a Cyber Demorph. The Cyber Demorphs come from the oldest captured civilization, which went too far with tech and lost their identity. Demorphs took them over early on, merging their advanced tech into themselves. They're a reminder of what happens when you lose yourself to technology. Let your NFT be a guide into a world of wonders and discoveries. Keep it close, as it is the key to the unseen, and prepare yourself for new mysteries that await you. Welcome to the unknown!"
