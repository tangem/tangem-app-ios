/// Card validation mode. In light mode, optional curves are not validated. This is an exception for Wallet 1 and the BLS curve. Since the curve `bls12381_G2_AUG` was added later into first generation of wallets,, we cannot determine whether this curve is missing due to an error or because the user did not want to recreate the wallet.
