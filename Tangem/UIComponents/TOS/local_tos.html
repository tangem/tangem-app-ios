    </p>

    <h3>2. DISCLAIMER</h3>
    <p>
      2.1. Blockchain Assets are virtual currencies, digital representations
      which may or may not represent access to real-world assets or claims, and
      that are neither issued by a central bank of any state or public authority
      attached to a conventional currency, but may be used by any natural or
      legal persons as a means of exchange and can be transferred, stored or
      traded electronically.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.2. Blockchain technologies and related services are subject to
      continuous regulatory changes and scrutiny around the world, including but
      not limited to sanctions, anti-money laundering and financial regulations.
      Given the peer-to-peer nature of blockchain transactions, there is no way
      to determine whether the counterparty to any transaction is a sanctioned
      person. User acknowledges that certain Services, including their
      availability, could be impacted by one or more regulatory requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.3. There is considerable exposure to risk in the Blockchain Asset
      exchange transaction. Any transaction involving the Blockchain Asset
      involves risks including, but not limited to, the potential for changing
      economic conditions that may substantially affect the price or liquidity
      of the Blockchain Asset. Investments in the Blockchain Asset exchange
      speculation may also be susceptible to sharp rises and falls as the
      relevant market values fluctuate. It is for this reason that when
      speculating in such markets it is advisable to use only risk capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.4. Tangem does not have the ability to reverse a transaction that is
      submitted to a blockchain protocol. User is responsible for ensuring that
      any Transaction details are accurate and complete. Tangem does not have
      the ability to review the accuracy of Transactions, and is not responsible
      for any losses due to User errors, including an incorrectly constructed
      Transaction. Further, User acknowledges that since smart contracts
      typically cannot be stopped or reversed, vulnerabilities in their
      programming and design or other vulnerabilities that may arise due to
      hacking or other security incidents can have adverse effects to Blockchain
      Assets, including but not limited to significant volatility and risk of
      loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.5. No part of the information herein or on the Official Mobile
      Application should be considered to be business, legal, financial or tax
      advice. The User should consult their own legal, financial, tax or other
      professional advisor regarding the matter. Tangem does not have a
      fiduciary relationship or obligation to the User regarding any decisions
      or activities effected when using the Services. No advice or information,
      whether oral or written, obtained from Tangem, or through the Services,
      will create any warranty or representation not expressly made herein.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.6. By using the Services, User represents that Tangem is not responsible
      for providing any tax information or tax reporting, and User agrees that
      it is responsible for determining the amount of, reporting and paying any
      and all taxes, duties and assessments now or hereafter claimed or imposed
      by any governmental authority associated with your use of the Services,
      including any Transactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      2.7. Non-custodial nature. Tangem provides non-custodial wallet software
      only. Tangem is not a bank, broker, exchange, money services business, or
      other financial institution, and does not provide regulated financial
      services. Tangem does not custody, control, or possess User assets and
      does not execute transactions on User’s behalf.
    </p>

      Tangem Wallet.
    </p>
    <p>
      3.2. Tangem Wallet may be used for storage of Private Key and Public Key

      blockchain address.
    </p>
    <p>

      3.4. The Official Mobile Application is used to generate messages that are

      Blockchain Assets (including staking rewards and earnings through yield
      protocols), and is unable to initiate or block transactions on your
      behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      3.5. When using the Official Mobile Application, Users are able to
      construct and determine, at the User’s own discretion, the parameters that
      will apply to Transactions. Tangem is not advising on the merits of any
      particular transaction or its tax or legal consequences. User is solely
      liable for any transactions conducted using the Official Mobile
      Application, including all financial and tax consequences thereof. Tangem
      is not responsible for indicating, alerting or warning against any such
      matters. No content made available through the Official Mobile Application
      or the Official Website is intended as tax, legal, financial or investment
      advice, and nothing thereon should be construed as an offer to enter into
      any transaction or to buy or sell a security or other financial product or
      a solicitation, recommendation or advice in relation to any transaction.
      User agrees that it is not entering into an advisory relationship with
      Tangem.
    </p>
    <p>
      3.6. User represents and warrants that it is not a person or entity that
      is (a) the subject of any economic or trade sanctions administered or
      enforced by any governmental authority, including being designated on any
      list of prohibited or restricted parties by any governmental authority,
      such as the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated

      List, the E.U. Consolidated List of persons and the U.K. Consolidated List
      of Financial Sanctions Targets, (b) located, a resident of or organized in
      any jurisdiction or territory that is the subject of comprehensive

      of the European Union, United Kingdom or the United States, or (c) owned
      or controlled by such persons or entities listed in (a)-(b).
    </p>
    <p>
      3.7. User acknowledges and agrees that it is solely responsible for
      complying with all applicable laws of the jurisdiction in which User is
      located in connection with use of the Services.

      stored by the User, to restore access to their Private Keys and associated
      Blockchain Assets in any third-party wallet application that supports the
      same industry standards (e.g., BIP39). The 25-year warranty in Clause 6.1
      applies exclusively to the physical integrity and cryptographic
      functionality of the Tangem Wallet’s chip and does not guarantee the
      perpetual availability of the Official Mobile Application.
    </p>
    <p>
      6.3. <strong>No access to critical data.</strong> Tangem does not have
      access to, collect, or store any personal financial data, including but
      not limited to credit card information, bank account details, or
      transaction histories associated with identifiable users. Additionally,
      Tangem’s core principle is that the User has full control over their
      assets. Tangem does not have access to and does not store the User's
      Private Keys, Recovery Phrase, PIN, passphrases, or other critical
      credentials required to control Blockchain Assets.
    </p>
    <p>
      6.4. To provide and improve the Services, including for purposes such as
      sending push notifications about transaction statuses, Tangem may collect
      and process a limited set of technical and usage data. The collection and
      processing of any personal data are performed strictly to deliver the
      functionality of the Services and are governed by the User's consent and
      the terms of our Privacy Policy. For a detailed description of the data we
      collect and the purposes for its use, please refer to our Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      6.5. <strong>No backup.</strong> Tangem does not provide backup or
      recovery of Private Key and Public Key stored by Tangem Wallet.
    </p>
    <p>
      6.6. <strong>No duplication.</strong> The Tangem Wallet’s chip is designed
      to prevent the direct extraction, cloning, or duplication of the Private
      Key stored within its secure element. However, User acknowledges that the
      Recovery Phrase allows for the restoration of the Private Keys on other
      devices. The User is solely responsible for the secure storage and
      handling of their Recovery Phrase to prevent unauthorized access and
      duplication of their wallet.
    </p>

    <h3>7. USER RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>

    <p class="inner">
      7.1.1. Upon receiving the Tangem Wallet, User should download Official
      Mobile Application in order to create the backup and if applicable
      determine the amount of Blockchain Asset stored through Official Mobile
      Application.
    </p>

    <p class="inner">
      7.1.2. User shall keep the means of access and Tangem Wallet with care and
      all Tangem Wallets separate from each other.
    </p>
    <p class="inner">
      7.1.3. User must always know where Tangem Wallet is and regularly ensure
      that it is still in their possession. User shall be the only person having
      physical access to Tangem Wallet and avoid even temporary possession of
      Tangem Wallet by any other person.
    </p>
    <p class="inner">
      7.1.4. User shall treat Tangem Wallet in the same manner as physical money
      (cash) and keep it safe. If Tangem Wallet is lost, stolen or destroyed,
      control over the corresponding Private Keys and any Blockchain Assets in
      any associated Blockchain addresses may be permanently lost.
    </p>
    <p class="inner">
      7.1.5. Before using the Tangem Wallet with Official Mobile Application,
      User shall locate Official Mobile Application in Google Play or Apple app
      store and install it as instructed in the Tangem Wallet box.
    </p>
    <p class="inner">
      7.1.6. Tangem Wallet shall be used only with Official Mobile Application
      and as instructed in the Tangem Wallet box.
    </p>
    <p class="inner">

    <p class="inner">
      7.1.9. Tangem Wallet shall be used only for physically tapping and holding

    </p>
    <p class="inner">
      7.1.10. User shall keep Tangem Wallet with care and protect Tangem Wallet

      their credentials in a secure location, away from prying eyes.
    </p>
    <p class="inner">

      knowledge of one or more of User’s Recovery Phrase can gain control of the
      Private Keys associated with User’s Tangem Wallet or of the Recovery
      Phrase, and therefore steal User’s Blockchain Assets, without any
      possibility for User or Tangem to retrieve them.
    </p>
    <p>
      7.2. User is liable for all liabilities arising from the use of Tangem
      Wallet and/or Tangem Official Mobile Application. Any disputes in relation
      to discrepancies and complaints about goods or services and any resulting
      claims must be settled directly by User with the respective reseller.
    </p>
    <p>
      7.3. As a matter of principle, User is liable for any risks resulting from
      the misuse of Tangem Wallet and/or Official Mobile Application. In any
      case, User is solely liable for all Transactions authorized using a means
      of access.
    </p>
    <p>
      7.4. Any loss or damage resulting from the forwarding of Tangem Wallet
      and/or means of access shall be borne by User.
    </p>
    <p>
      7.5. Loss or damage incurred by User in connection with the possession or
      use of Tangem Wallet and/or Official Mobile Application shall be borne
      solely by User. Except for the obligations set forth in the Tangem Wallet
      Warranty (Clause 6.1), Tangem assumes no liability if Tangem Wallet and/or

      adjusted.
    </p>
    <p>
      7.6. User is only permitted to use Tangem Wallet and Official Mobile
      Application for their personal, non-commercial use. User is not allowed to
      resell Tangem Wallet.
    </p>
    <p>
      7.7. Before User engages in Transactions using an electronic system, User
      should carefully review the rules and regulations of the exchanges
      offering the system and/or listing the instruments User intends to trade.
      Online trading has inherent risk due to system response and access times
      that may vary due to market conditions, system performance, and other
      factors. User should understand, fully accept and take on these and
      additional risks before trading.
    </p>
    <p>
      7.8. Before initiating any Transactions through third-party resources via
      widgets or links within the application, User is expressly advised to
      meticulously review and comprehend the terms, rules, and regulations
      governing such resources. It is imperative for User to be cognizant of the
      inherent risks associated with online trading, including variations in
      system response times, access delays influenced by market conditions,
      system performance, and other pertinent factors.
    </p>
    <p>
      7.9. User unequivocally assumes sole responsibility for all actions
      undertaken, encompassing but not limited to swap transactions, on-ramp,
      and off-ramp activities, when transitioning to third-party resources
      through widgets or links within the application. This responsibility
      extends to compliance with the terms and conditions of the relevant
      third-party resources and adherence to applicable laws and regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      7.10. Tangem explicitly disclaims any affiliation, endorsement, or
      responsibility for the content, policies, or Transactions on third-party
      resources, and User interactions with such resources are entirely at their
      own risk.

      10.1. <b>Overview.</b> Using Official Mobile Application, User can
      participate in staking certain cryptocurrencies to earn rewards for
      supporting Proof-of-Stake (POS) networks. User is to review the
      information about staking the token, including the APR, Unbonding period,
      and reward schedule and has the option to choose a validator, which are
      listed by APR offered. TANGEM OFFERS NO RECOMMENDATIONS OR ADVICE ON
      STAKING OR THE SELECTION OF VALIDATORS AND RESERVES THE RIGHT TO CHANGE
      THE LIST OF AVAILABLE VALIDATORS AT ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE.
    </p>
    <p>
      10.2. <b>Rewards.</b> By staking User's assets, User acknowledges that
      delegating staking rights to a validator as listed in Official Mobile
      Application does not entitle User to any specific payments but potentially
      allows User to share in rewards collected by the validator.
    </p>
    <p>
      10.3. <b>Asset Custody.</b> Tangem does not hold custody of any rewards or
      assets User receives; it also has no control over or responsibility for
      the operations of any POS network where User delegates validation rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      10.4. <b>Reward Guarantees.</b> TANGEM MAKES NO PROMISES THAT USER WILL
      EARN ANY STAKING REWARDS OR ACHIEVE ANY PARTICULAR REWARD RATES. The
      delivery of rewards is dependent on the functioning of the respective POS
      networks and is beyond Tangem's influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      10.5. <b>Service Disclaimer.</b> The staking services are provided on an
      “as is” basis. Tangem is not liable for any failures in transferring
      rewards by supported POS networks, including, but not limited to market
      risks, inflation risks, risks of “slashing”, or for any rewards sent to an
      incorrect wallet address. Tangem does not ensure that the staking services
      will be uninterrupted, free of errors, or secure against third-party
      disturbances or unauthorized access.
    </p>
    <p>
      10.6. <b>Fees.</b> Tangem may charge a service fee, which is calculated as
      a percentage of the staking rewards earned by the User. The estimated
      reward rates (e.g., APR) displayed within the Official Mobile Application
      are presented to the User net of such fees. By participating in the
      staking service, the User agrees to this fee structure. The specific fee
      details will be disclosed within the Official Mobile Application.

      access DeFi Protocols, such as Aave, that enable User to allocate
      Blockchain Assets into liquidity or lending protocols ("Yield Services").

      price predictions, or personalized financial advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      11.3. <b>No Endorsement.</b> The availability of integrations with DeFi
      Protocols, such as Aave, within the Official Mobile Application does not
      constitute a recommendation, endorsement, or guarantee of suitability or
      safety. User must independently evaluate and determine whether to use such
      protocols. The inclusion of a specific protocol does not imply it is
      risk-free or compliant with User's jurisdiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      11.4. <b>Third-Party Terms.</b> User's interactions with Yield Services
      are governed solely by the respective third-party DeFi Protocol’s terms
      and conditions. Tangem does not control or influence the smart contracts,
      rules, or outcomes of these protocols and is not a party to any agreements
      User may enter into by allocating Blockchain Assets.
    </p>
    <p>
      11.5. <b>Asset Custody and Control. </b> Tangem does not hold custody of
      any Blockchain Assets, rewards, or yield generated through Yield Services.
      Tangem has no control over or responsibility for the operations of any
      DeFi Protocol. User retains full custody and control over their Blockchain
      Assets through their Private Keys at all times.
    </p>
    <p>
      11.6. <b>No Guarantees. </b> TANGEM MAKES NO PROMISES THAT USER WILL EARN
      ANY YIELD OR ACHIEVE ANY PARTICULAR OUTCOMES FROM YIELD SERVICES. Any
      yield, performance, or returns are determined solely by the underlying
      DeFi Protocol and market conditions, which may vary, cease, or result in
      losses at any time. Tangem does not guarantee the availability, security,
      or uninterrupted operation of Yield Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      11.7. <b>Risks.</b> Allocating Blockchain Assets into DeFi Protocols

      yield generated from the User's allocated Blockchain Assets. The estimated
      yield rates displayed within the Official Mobile Application are presented

      any blockchain network fees ("gas") or fees charged by the third-party
      DeFi Protocol.

    <p class="inner">
      11.9.2. <b>Third-Party Fees:</b> Additional fees, such as gas fees or

      or DeFi Protocol. Tangem does not control or influence these fees and is
      not responsible for their accuracy or application.
    </p>
    <p>
      User is responsible for reviewing and accepting all applicable fees before

      independent research, consult professional advisors, and perform due

      Yield Services, including those from smart contract failures, market
