// Marks transaction as invalid if the top stack item is greater than the transaction's nLockTime field, otherwise script evaluation continues as though an OP_NOP was executed. Transaction is also invalid if
// 1. the stack is empty; or
// 2. the top stack item is negative; or
// 3. the top stack item is greater than or equal to 500000000 while the transaction's nLockTime field is less than 500000000, or vice versa; or
// 4. the input's nSequence field is equal to 0xffffffff.
// The precise semantics are described in BIP 0065.
