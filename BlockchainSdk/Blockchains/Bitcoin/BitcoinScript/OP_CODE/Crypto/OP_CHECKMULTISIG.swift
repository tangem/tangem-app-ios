// Compares the first signature against each public key until it finds an ECDSA match. Starting
// with the subsequent public key, it compares the second signature against each remaining public key
// until it finds an ECDSA match. The process is repeated until all signatures have been checked or not
// enough public keys remain to produce a successful result. All signatures need to match a public key.
// Because public keys are not checked again if they fail any signature comparison, signatures must be
// placed in the scriptSig using the same order as their corresponding public keys were placed in the
// scriptPubKey or redeemScript. If all signatures are valid, 1 is returned, 0 otherwise. Due to a bug,
// one extra unused value is removed from the stack.
