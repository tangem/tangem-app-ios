         Gives an estimate of the gas unit price required to get a transaction on chain in a reasonable amount of time. The gas unit price is the amount that each transaction commits to pay for each unit of gas consumed in executing the transaction. The estimate is based on recent history: it gives the minimum gas that would have been required to get into recent blocks, for blocks that were full. (When blocks are not full, the estimate will match the minimum gas unit price.)

         The estimation is given in three values: de-prioritized (low), regular, and prioritized (aggressive). Using a more aggressive value increases the likelihood that the transaction will make it into the next block; more aggressive values are computed with a larger history and higher percentile statistics. More details are in AIP-34.

However, it will not have the associated state hashes, as they are not updated in storage. This can be used to estimate the maximum gas units for a submitted transaction.

         To use this, you must:

         - Create a SignedTransaction with a zero-padded signature.
         - Submit a SubmitTransactionRequest containing a UserTransactionRequest containing that signature.

         Encode the transaction as BCS. If you are using a language that has
         native BCS support, make sure of that library. If not, you may take advantage of /transactions/encode_submission. When using this endpoint, make sure you trust the node you're talking to, as it is possible they could manipulate your request. 2. Sign the encoded transaction and use it to create a TransactionSignature. 3. Submit the request. Make sure to use the "application/json" Content-Type.

         To submit a transaction as BCS, you must submit a SignedTransaction encoded as BCS. See SignedTransaction in types/src/transaction/mod.rs. Make sure to use the application/x.aptos.signed_transaction+bcs Content-Type.
