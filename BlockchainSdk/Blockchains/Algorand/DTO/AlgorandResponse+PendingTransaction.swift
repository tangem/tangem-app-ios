/*
 Given a transaction ID of a recently submitted transaction, it returns information about it. There are several cases when this might succeed:
 - transaction committed (committed round > 0)
 - transaction still in the pool (committed round = 0, pool error = "")
 - transaction removed from pool due to error (committed round = 0, pool error != "")

 Or the transaction may have happened sufficiently long ago that the node no longer remembers it, and this will return an error.
