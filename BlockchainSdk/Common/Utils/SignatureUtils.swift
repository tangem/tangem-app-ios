    ///   - originalSignature: The original `Data` object representing the signature to be unmarshalled.
    ///   - publicKey: The `Data` object representing the public key associated with the signature.
    ///   - hash: The `Data` object representing the hash of the message or transaction.

    ///   concatenated with the adjusted recovery ID.
    /// - Throws: `WalletError.failedToBuildTx` if the unmarshalling process fails due to an invalid recovery ID.
    ///
    /// - Important: For certain blockchains, especially those using the Secp256k1 curve, signature unmarshalling
    ///   is required to correctly reconstruct the signature from the original data. This process involves verifying
    ///   and adjusting the recovery ID, which is essential for ensuring the signature is valid and can be used for
    ///   transaction verification. The function checks the length of the recovery ID and adjusts it within valid bounds
    ///   before concatenating it with the `r` and `s` components of the signature.
