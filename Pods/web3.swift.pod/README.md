## Design Decisions

- Not every JSON RPC function is exposed yet, and priority is given to the ones required for mobile devices
- Functionality was focused on serializing and signing transactions locally on the device to send raw transactions to Ethereum network
- Requirements for password input on every transaction are indeed a design decision. Interface designers can save user passwords with the user's consent
- Public function for private key export is exposed for user convenience but marked as UNSAFE_ :) Normal workflow takes care of EIP155 compatibility and proper clearing of private key data from memory

## Installation

- CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate web3swift into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '9.0'

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    use_frameworks!
    pod 'web3.swift.pod', '~> 2.2.0'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

- Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate web3swift into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`.
Create an empty Cartfile with the touch command and open it:

```bash
$ touch Cartfile
$ open -a Xcode Cartfile
```

Add the following line to the Cartfile and save it:

```ogdl
github "matter-labs/web3swift" "master"
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework. By default, Carthage performs checkouts and builds in a new directory 'Carthage' in the same location as your Cartfile. Open this directory, go to 'Build' directory, choose iOS or macOS directory and use the framework from the chosen directory in your Xcode project.


### Requirements

## FAQ

> Is it possible to get a Mnemonic Phrase (Seed Phrase) from Private key using web3swift?

In web3swift there is no backward conversion from Private key to Mnemonic Phrase. Also it is theoretically impossible to recover a phrase from a Private key. After Seed Phrase is converted to some initial entropy the “master key is derived” and the initial entropy is discarded.

The simplest solution is to encrypt the phrase using users pincode and save it in some other secure keystore.
Mnemonic Phrase is very sensitive data and you must be very careful to let the user get it.
Our advise if you want to show it to a user - ask to save a Passphrase when creating BIP32Keystore.

> How to interact with custom smart-contract with web3swift?

For example: you want to interact with smart-contract and all you know is - its address (address example: 0xfa28eC7198028438514b49a3CF353BcA5541ce1d).

You can get the ABI of your contract directly from [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) ([Solution](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/27536/where-to-find-contract-abi-in-new-version-of-online-remix-solidity-compiler?rq=1))

Then you should use contract address and ABI in creating contract object. In example we use Infura Mainnet:
```swift
let yourContractABI: String = <CONTRACT JSON ABI>
let toEthereumAddress: EthereumAddress = <DESTINATION ETHEREUM ADDRESS>
let abiVersion: Int = <ABI VERSION NUMBER>

let contract = Web3.InfuraMainnetWeb3().contract(yourContractABI, at: toEthereumAddress, abiVersion: abiVersion)
```
Here is the example how you should call some contract method:
```swift
let method: String = <CONTRACT METHOD NAME>
let parameters: [AnyObject] = <PARAMETERS>
let extraData: Data = <DATA>
let transactionOptions: TransactionOptions = <OPTIONS>

let transaction = contract.read(method, parameters: parameters, extraData: extraData, transactionOptions: transactionOptions)
```

Here is the example how you should send transaction to some contract method:
```swift
let method: String = <CONTRACT METHOD NAME>
let parameters: [AnyObject] = <PARAMETERS>
let extraData: Data = <DATA>
let transactionOptions: TransactionOptions = <OPTIONS>

let transaction = contract.write(method, parameters: parameters, extraData: extraData, transactionOptions: transactionOptions)
```

> How to set test local node?
You can write something like that:
```swift
func setLocalNode(port: Int = 8545) -> Web3? {
    guard let web3 = Web3(url: URL(string: "http://127.0.0.1:\(port)")!) else { return nil }
    return web3
}
```
